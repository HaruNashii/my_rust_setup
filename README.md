I distro hop a lot so i made this script to setup everything quickly

this script does :
- install the apps i use for programming (Neovim, Tmux, Ranger, Rust, Cargo, Git and GCM)
- install my personal config to (Neovim, Tmux and Git)
- Make some aliases that i like to use
- Make my directories that i use to maintain my project more organized

This script supports only distro with the following package managers : 
- APT (Debian, Ubuntu, Etc..)
- DNF (Fedora, Nobara, Etc..)
- Pacman (Arch, CachyOS, Etc..)
