I distro hop a lot so i made this script to setup everything quickly

this script does :
- install the apps i use for programming like (Neovim, Tmux, Rust, Cargo, Git and GCM)
- install my personal config to (Neovim, Tmux and Git)
- Make some aliases that i like to use
- Make my directories that i use to maintain my project more organized

This script supports only Debian based (APT) distros and Arch based (Pacman) distros [ no fedora support yet :( ]
